# Farcaster Frames - Next.js Examples

## 👀 Watch the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/g_pkATT8pYU?si=8KwGSzJ_nxWHx-k3)

Paste the live demo url into https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames to validate the frame.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies

# Install dependencies

npm install

```

Next, create a `.env` file in the root of your project (you can copy from `.env.example`) and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

If your website is not deployed, you may not have a public URL just yet. In that case, use localhost("http://localhost:3000").

```

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com

````

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Database

The project uses firebase. Setup firebase project and create web app. Paste the configuration details in ".env" file.

## Deployment

Since we are building on Next.js, it is recommended to deploy using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) so you can take advantage of the Open Graph Image Generator in the Advanced example.

Regardless of where you deploy, make sure you set up the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in the environment variables.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

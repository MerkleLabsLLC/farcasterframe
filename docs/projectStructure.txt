1. public -> public folder typically consists of assets which can be retrieve directly via project url. 
             These assets include images, fonts, videos, and any other files that should be served directly to the client without any processing or transformation.

            jananibase -> it consists the base images that are randomised and used as background image for frame.
                          If you wish to add more base images, follow the same naming standard. 
                          DONOT BREAK THE NUMBER SEQUENCE WHILE ADDING/EDITING IMAGES.

            "jananisiteimage.png" is used as image for static initial frame.

2. quotes -> quotes are included in the folder. If you wish to add more quotes, add on "quote.txt".
             run "npm run generateQuotes" on terminal to generate array of quotes from the text file. The file will be saved in "quotes.js" 

3. src/app -> Project code sits here.
              
              api -> APIs that are used for the project is created here. The folder name specifies its route. 
              
              fortune -> "/fortune" will be the initial frame to load. 

              myfortune -> The frame is used when user shares his/her fortune.

              prediction -> to generated image from the prediction. If image has been changed, change the dimension of image specified in the file

4. firebase -> Database is setup using firebase. The config of firebase sits here.
